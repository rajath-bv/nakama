# Nakama
Find teammates for projects.

## Motivation 

### What we want to solve

University students find a hard time forming a team consisting of members who are skilled in a particular technology / field. 
Initially they ask friends and classmates but, many a time, they do not find suitable teammates intheir immediate vicinity.

## What is Nakama?

[Nakama](https://nakama-sage.vercel.app/) is a web platform where students can post their idea for a personal project and the skills required to build it. Our platform connects these users to other students who are skilled in these technologies.

As a project poster, you can filter which users you want to work with, based on their profile, previous projects and a rating system describing how effective that person was in the previous team.

Students all over the world can work on interesting projects and learn skills from their newly formed teammates.
